    "\n",
    "## 📌 Core Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is an open protocol + Python SDK that helps you design, run, and manage **LLM-driven tools** with structured inputs, contextual memory, and precise outputs — across both **local development** and **production servers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as a **tool-based orchestration framework** for LLMs that feels like writing simple Python functions, but runs like a powerful AI agent backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🤖 Key Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Don’t just prompt a model — structure, invoke, and interpret its actions like a tool-based system.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are great at generating content, but:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ❌ They lack **consistency** in outputs.\n",
    "* ❌ They don’t natively support **tools or APIs**.\n",
    "* ❌ They forget context across steps.\n",
    "* ❌ They can’t return **typed structured data** easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "MCP solves this by introducing:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tools** – Wrap Python functions as callable LLM tools\n",
    "* **Structured Outputs** – Validate LLM results using schemas\n",
    "* **Context Memory** – Track state across invocations\n",
    "* **Prompt Templates** – Cleanly separate logic from language\n",
    "* **Sampling & Elicitation** – Guide or extract info interactively\n",
