    "## 📌 What It Covers\n",
    "\n",
    "Core Concepts are the **fundamental components** that power the entire MCP system — these include **tools**, **prompts**, **structured outputs**, **context**, and more. Each concept plays a vital role in building a robust and intelligent AI toolchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔧 1. Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🧩 Your Python functions turned into AI tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Decorated with `@tool` to expose functionality\n",
    "* Receive structured input → Return structured output\n",
    "* Invokable via CLI or server\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from mcp import tool\n",
    "\n",
    "@tool(name=\"greet\")\n",
    "def greet_user(name: str) -> str:\n",
    "    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✍️ 2. Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "> Templates for language model input — separated from logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Defined as `.txt` or `.jinja` files\n",
    "* Accept variables and render with context\n",
    "* Plug directly into tools or run standalone\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Dear {{ name }},\n",
    "\n",
    "Hope you're having a great day!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧾 3. Structured Output\n",
    "\n",
    "> Define expected LLM response shapes using schemas.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ensures output is valid JSON, not just free text\n",
    "* Great for chaining tools and APIs\n",
    "* Reduces hallucination and parsing errors\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from mcp import StructuredOutput\n",
    "\n",
    "schema = StructuredOutput(fields={\"summary\": str, \"keywords\": list})\n",

    "## 🧩 4. Context\n",
    "\n",
    "> Persistent memory between tool and prompt invocations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Automatically passed between steps\n",
    "* Used to build multi-step reasoning agents\n",
    "* Carries history, variables, metadata, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "context[\"previous_result\"] = \"Summary: ...\"\n",

    "## 💬 5. Completions\n",
    "\n",
    "> Direct interaction with LLMs (OpenAI, Claude, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Can be embedded in tools\n",
    "* Support for raw or structured output\n",
    "* Works with custom prompts or default generation\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from mcp import Completion\n",

    "> Specialized prompt strategies to extract targeted info.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Uses predefined prompt patterns\n",
    "* Helps control LLM behavior better\n",
    "* Often paired with structured output\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎲 7. Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "> Adds randomness and creativity to outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Adjust temperature, top\\_p, etc.\n",
    "* Used inside `Completion.run()` or prompt rendering\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📢 8. Logging & Notifications\n",
    "\n",
    "> Track what happens at each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Automatically logs tool runs, inputs, and outputs\n",
    "* Helpful for debugging, observability, and analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔐 9. Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "> Secure your MCP API with keys or headers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Add authentication middleware\n",
    "* Useful when serving publicly or in production\n",
