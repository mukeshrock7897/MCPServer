    "## 📌 What It Does\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Images` module in MCP allows tools to **accept image inputs**, **return generated images**, or **reference them in prompts** — making it easy to handle **visual tasks** like generation, classification, and captioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "MCP natively supports **structured image inputs and outputs** — which means **multi-modal workflows** are now possible with **structured, typed image data**.\n",
